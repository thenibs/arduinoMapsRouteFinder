Assignment 2: Driving Route Finder Part 2
***Consulted C++, Arduino, Adafruit GFX Documentation***

Included Files/Directories:
	-client/
	-server/
	-README

CLIENT (client/) -----------------------------------

Files Included in client/:
	-client.cpp (edited, see notes)
	-draw_route.cpp (edited)
	-draw_route.h
	-serial_handling.cpp (edited)
	-serial_handling.h (edited)
	-map_drawing.cpp
	-map_drawing.h
	-consts_and_types.h
	-Makefile

Accesories:
	-Arduino MEGA 2560
	-TFT Display
	-Breadboard
	-2 Pushbuttons
	-5 Breakout Wires (Female to Male)
	-5+ Breakout Wires (Male to Male)

Wiring Instructions:
	-Arduino GND <M--F> Joystick Pin GND
	-Arduino 5V <M--F> Joystick Pin 5V
	-Arduino Pin A8 <M--F> Joystick Pin VRy
	-Arduino Pin A9 <M--F> Joystick Pin VRx
	-Arduino Pin 53 <M--F> Joystick Pin SW

	-Arduino GND <M--M> Breadboard Negative Terminal
	-Arduino Pin 47 <M--M> Pushbutton (Zoom Out) <M--M> Breadboard Negative Rail
	-Arduino Pin 45 <M--M> Pushbutton (Zoom In) <M--M> Breadboard Negative Rail

	***Attach TFT Display (by lining up the matching pins) AFTER connecting wires***

Notes and Assumptions:
	-Follows all assumptions from the assignment
	-Edited client.cpp to match our implementation of draw_route() and display extra status messages

--------------------------------------------------


SERVER (server/) ---------------------------------

Files Included in server/:
	-digraph.cpp
	-digraph.h
	-dijkstra.cpp
	-dijkstra.h
	-edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt
	-heap.h
	-serialport.cpp
	-serialport.h
	-server.cpp (edited from part1)
	-wdigraph.h
	-Makefile (edited from part1)

Makefile Targets:
	- make: Builds objects and executable for the program "server"
	- make clean: Remove all object files and executables
	- original part1 targets: dijkstra.o, server.o & digraph.o
	- added new target for part2: serialport.o

Notes and Assumptions:
	-Follows all assumptions from the assignment

--------------------------------------------------

Running Instructions:
		1. Connect the Arduino Mega 2560 (with Display and Joystick Wired) through an A-B style USB cable to the computer
		2. Ensure the Arduino is using the proper port: /dev/ttyACM0 or - ACM1 ("arduino-port-select" in CML, hit "1" twice)
		3. Navigate to the client/ directory and enter "make && make upload"
		4. Ensure "avrdude done. Thank you." is visible at some point
		5. Navigate to the server/ directory and enter "make && ./server"
		6. Program Functions:
			Use joystick to move around the map of Edmonton. Use respective push buttons to zoom in or out.

			To select a starting ("FROM?") location, push the joystick. Next move to desired end ("TO?") location and push the joystick again.

			The Arduino will send the location ("Obtaining route...") to the server which will try to return a path. If a path exists ("Updating map..."), the route will be drawn. If no path exists ("Path DNE... FROM?"), select new points.
